cl-rsvg2 is a Common Lisp binding to RSVG Library to allow rendering
SVGs to Cairo surfaces.

It requires cffi, asdf, cl-cairo2, cl-gtk2, and naturally, librsvg.

So far it has been tested against librsvg 2.34.1 with SBCL 1.0.54 under
Ubuntu GNU/Linux.

It is a fork of cl-rsvg by Sasha Kovar which was using cl-cairo instead
of cl-cairo2.  It also uses the cl-gtk2-glib system of cl-gtk2 for a
few definitions that cl-rsvg made itself.  If anyone should want to use
the library but like to avoid this dependency, contact me so I can make
a light version without it.

The mapping was somewhat minimal in cl-rsvg.  I added FFI declarations
for most (non-deprecated) functions of the RSVG Library, but not
tested them.  The GdkPixmap functions are in a seperate sytem which
depends upon cl-ftk2-gdk.  The tested functionaly consists only of what
is required to load SVG files and render them to Cairo.  The only
exported function is DRAW-SVG-FILE which is high-level wrapper for
doing just that.  Originally it was not part of the library, but of
the test.  If you need more high-level functionality or have used
some of the untested functionality and noticed problems, contact me!

tests/cairo-test.lisp contains example usage.
