cl-rsvg2 is a Common Lisp binding to RSVG Library to allow rendering
SVGs to Cairo surfaces.

It requires cffi, asdf, cl-cairo2, cl-gtk2, and naturally, librsvg.

So far it has been tested against librsvg 2.34.1 with SBCL 1.0.54 under
Ubuntu GNU/Linux.

It is a fork of cl-rsvg by Sasha Kovar which was using cl-cairo instead
of cl-cairo2.  It also uses the cl-gtk2-glib system of cl-gtk2 for a
few definitions that cl-rsvg made itself.  If anyone should want to use
the library but like to avoid this dependency, contact me so I can make
a light version without it.

The mapping is somewhat minimal at the moment, consisting only of what
is required to load SVG files and render them to Cairo.  It has been
made slightly more high-level by including the DRAW-SVG-FILE function
in the library which was only in the test in cl-revg.  Contact me if
you need more :)

tests/cairo-test.lisp contains example usage.
