cl-rsvg is a Common Lisp binding to librsvg to allow rendering SVGs to
Cairo surfaces.

It requires cffi, asdf, cl-cairo, and naturally, librsvg.

So far it has been tested against librsvg 2.16.0 with SBCL 0.9.14 under
Debian GNU/Linux.

The mapping is somewhat minimal at the moment, consisting only of what
is required to load SVG files and render them to Cairo.  Bother the
author if you need more :)

tests/cairo-test.lisp contains example usage.
